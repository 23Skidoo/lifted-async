-- | Generalized version of 'A.Concurrently'.
--
-- A value of type @Concurrently b m a@ is an IO-based operation that can be
-- composed with other 'Concurrently' values, using the 'Applicative' and
-- 'Alternative' instances.
--
-- Calling 'runConcurrently' on a value of type @Concurrently b m a@ will
-- execute the IO-based lifted operations it contains concurrently, before
-- delivering the result of type 'a'.
--
-- For example
--
-- > (page1, page2, page3) <- runConcurrently $ (,,)
-- >   <$> Concurrently (getURL "url1")
-- >   <*> Concurrently (getURL "url2")
-- >   <*> Concurrently (getURL "url3")

-- NOTE: The phantom type variable @b :: * -> *@ in 'Concurrently' is needed to
-- avoid @UndecidableInstances@ in the following instance declarations.
-- See https://github.com/maoe/lifted-async/issues/4 for alternative
-- implementaions.
