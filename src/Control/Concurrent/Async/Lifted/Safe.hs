-- | Generalized version of 'A.Concurrently'.
--
-- A value of type @Concurrently b m a@ is an IO-based operation that can be
-- composed with other 'Concurrently' values, using the 'Applicative' and
-- 'Alternative' instances.
--
-- Calling 'runConcurrently' on a value of type @Concurrently b m a@ will
-- execute the IO-based lifted operations it contains concurrently, before
-- delivering the result of type 'a'.
--
-- For example
--
-- > (page1, page2, page3) <- runConcurrently $ (,,)
-- >   <$> Concurrently (getURL "url1")
-- >   <*> Concurrently (getURL "url2")
-- >   <*> Concurrently (getURL "url3")
-- newtype Concurrently (b :: * -> *) m a = Concurrently { runConcurrently :: m a }
--
-- NOTE: The phantom type variable @b :: * -> *@ in 'Concurrently' is needed to
-- avoid @UndecidableInstances@ in the following instance declarations.
-- See https://github.com/maoe/lifted-async/issues/4 for alternative
-- implementaions.
--
-- instance (b ~ IO, Functor m) => Functor (Concurrently b m) where

--   pure = Concurrently . pure
--   Concurrently fs <*> Concurrently as = undefined
--     -- Concurrently $ uncurry ($) <$> concurrently fs as
--
-- instance (b ~ IO, MonadBaseControl b m) => Alternative (Concurrently b m) where
--   empty = Concurrently . liftBaseWith . const $ forever (threadDelay maxBound)
--   Concurrently as <|> Concurrently bs = undefined
--     -- Concurrently $ either id id <$> race as bs
--
-- instance Monad m => Monad (Concurrently b m) where
--   return = Concurrently . return
--   Concurrently a >>= f = Concurrently $ a >>= runConcurrently . f

-- | Type restricted version of `Control.restoreM`.
--
-- The constraint @'StM' m a ~ a@ says that 'restoreM' can be used in stateless
-- monads. It ensures that the user cannot mess up the monadic effects besides
-- IO.
--
-- If you'd like to use this library with a stateful monad, please use
-- 'Control.Concurrent.Async.Lifted.Unsafe' carefully instead.
