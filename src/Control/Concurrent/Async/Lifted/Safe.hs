Stability   : experimental

This is a wrapped version of "Control.Concurrent.Async" with types generalized
from 'IO' to all monads in either 'MonadBase' or 'MonadBaseControl'.

This module assumes your monad stack to satisfy @'StM' m a ~ a@ for safety.
The safety here means you can't accidentally overwrite monadic effects because
the monad stack doesn't have state in the first place. If your monad stack is
stateful, use @Control.Concurrent.Async.Lifted@ with special care.

#if MIN_VERSION_monad_control(1, 0, 0)
Caveat: Currently due to an implementation restriction, there's no
`A.Concurrently` type and accompanying functions.
#else
Caveat: This module is available only if built with @monad-control >= 1.0.0@.
If you have older @monad-control@, use @Control.Concurrent.Async.Lifted@.

--
-- A value of type @Concurrently b m a@ is an IO-based operation that can be
-- composed with other 'Concurrently' values, using the 'Applicative' and
-- 'Alternative' instances.
--
-- Calling 'runConcurrently' on a value of type @Concurrently b m a@ will
-- execute the IO-based lifted operations it contains concurrently, before
-- delivering the result of type 'a'.
--
-- For example
--
-- > (page1, page2, page3) <- runConcurrently $ (,,)
-- >   <$> Concurrently (getURL "url1")
-- >   <*> Concurrently (getURL "url2")
-- >   <*> Concurrently (getURL "url3")
-- newtype Concurrently (b :: * -> *) m a = Concurrently { runConcurrently :: m a }
--
-- NOTE: The phantom type variable @b :: * -> *@ in 'Concurrently' is needed to
-- avoid @UndecidableInstances@ in the following instance declarations.
-- See https://github.com/maoe/lifted-async/issues/4 for alternative
-- implementaions.
