Module      : Control.Concurrent.Async.Lifted.Safe
Copyright   : Copyright (C) 2012-2014 Mitsutoshi Aoe

Maintainer  : Mitsutoshi Aoe <maoe@foldr.in>
Stability   : experimental

This is a safe variant of @Control.Concurrent.Async.Lifted@.

This module assumes your monad stack to satisfy @'StM' m a ~ a@ so you can't
mess up monadic effects. If your monad stack is stateful, use
@Control.Concurrent.Async.Lifted@ with special care.

#if MIN_VERSION_monad_control(1, 0, 0)
#else
Caveat: This module is available only if built with @monad-control >= 1.0.0@.
If you have older @monad-control@, use @Control.Concurrent.Async.Lifted@.

-- A value of type @'Concurrently' b m a@ is an IO-based operation that can be

--
-- Calling 'runConcurrently' on a value of type @'Concurrently' b m a@ will
-- execute the IO-based lifted operations it contains concurrently, before
-- delivering the result of type 'a'.
--
-- For example
--
-- @
--   (page1, page2, page3) <- 'runConcurrently' $ (,,)
--     '<$>' 'Concurrently' (getURL "url1")
--     '<*>' 'Concurrently' (getURL "url2")
--     '<*>' 'Concurrently' (getURL "url3")

-- NOTE: The phantom type variable @b :: * -> *@ in 'Concurrently' is needed to
-- avoid @UndecidableInstances@ in the following instance declarations.
-- See https://github.com/maoe/lifted-async/issues/4 for alternative
-- implementaions.

-- | @'Pure' m a@ only means @m@ satisfies @'StM' m a ~ a@ (i.e. the monad
-- @m@ has no monadic state). The boring 'Pure' class is necessary just to
-- convince the GHC type checker.
